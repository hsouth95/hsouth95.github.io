                  <p>
                        I'm a Software Engineering student at Bournemouth University, Currently
                        in my final year studying Software Quality and Testing, Software Systems Modelling and Advanced Development.
                        I enjoy and have attended many hackathons, creating interesting applications such as
                        a fast-paced stock trading game and a text-to-web messenger.

                        I'm also a semi-avid runner, with ever fluctuating goals of running a half/full marathon.

                        I built a journal for my girlfriend who at the time was doing her
                        placement year in Japan! I used a range of technologies to
                        create a website hosted on Azure to allow for the creation of
                        simple journal entries alongside related images that were privately
                        hosted on imgur. A large part of this project was trying to reduce
                        the server-side load to allow for the cheapest possible hosting option.

                            First year assignment to build any game with a GUI element. I
                            built a Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a AI twist. The player
                            could choose the type of AI they wanted to play against, this
                            ranged from a simple 'random' AI which would have a 33% chance
                            of choosing anything. A 'State' AI which used a pre-defined
                            state diagram to choose its next play. Finally a 'Intelligent'
                            AI which built a pattern from previous plays and would try to
                            predict which move you'd make next.

                        Second year assignment to build a Battleships game as an Android App.
                        This project was a very nice introduction to Android, I utilised
                        many of the 'neat' little features such as vibrating the phone
                        when you hit another ship. Also had a few fun experiences of memory
                        management! Who would've thought I'd have to do that in Java?!

                        As part of my final year at Bournemouth University, I am required to partake in a
                        final year project. For mine I will be converting the paper-based systems that the
                        RBCH currently uses. I will be liaising with a client at the Hospital and will be using
                        Drupal to create a fully functional and usable prototype.
